Name: An Nguyen

1. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features:
- Randomly selected 25% of the data (269 files) from the train folder and put them into dev folder

2. Accuracy of baseline features during your evaluation: 0.7273193818783145

3. Describe your advanced feature set:
All the baseline_tagger feature with a modification for first utterance of each dialogue
    - Marking the first utterance of each dialogue: Modified from baseline_tagger. Instead of only include is_first
